### Business Problem Statement

In the fast-paced and competitive food industry, understanding sales performance is crucial for any business to thrive and grow. Our client, a renowned Pizza company, seeks to gain a comprehensive understanding of their sales performance for the fiscal year 2015. The objective of our Customer Sales Analysis project is to meticulously examine diverse facets within the sales data, uncover pertinent trends, and formulate actionable insights. Through this rigorous analysis, we aim to provide data-driven recommendations that will enable our client to make informed decisions and strategically plan for future growth and optimization. The challenge lies in effectively analyzing the vast amount of sales data to derive meaningful insights that can directly contribute to the company's bottom line and overall success.

#### KPI's Requirement

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

#### Charts Requirement & Explainatory Data Analysis (EDA)

We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:
- What is the daily trend for total orders?
- What is the hourly trend for total orders?
- What is the percentage of sales for each pizza category?
- What is the percentage of sales for each pizza size?
- How many total pizzas were sold for each pizza category?
- Which pizzas are the top 5 best sellers based on total pizzas sold?
- Which pizzas are the bottom 5 worst sellers based on total pizzas sold?

### Data source & Integrity

The Primary dataset used for this analysis is the [pizza_sales.xlsx](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AjKhR_ndv-LThkg2pyCeKcz983VS?e=7x3veL) file, containing detailed infoprmation about various aspects of the sales made by the company.
this Data was primarily Stored in a Kaggle dataset and was downloaded. The Data is in long format and was initially very Dirty. The data is Relialbe, Credible and comprehensive. it has all the information required for us to answer the bussiness questions. Initially SQL was used to clean and get our required KPI's and tables to form charts.

# `Process`

### Tools Used

- Microsoft SQL Server :- Initial Cleaning, filtering & sorting and Data Validation.
- Microsoft Excel :- Data cleaning, Data analysis and Visualisations.

#### **Data Integrity Assurance:**
   - Regularly conducted data integrity checks.
   - Implemented checksums and validation routines.

#### **Verification of Data Readiness:**
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) for outliers.
   - Validated data against predefined documentation done through SQL.

#### **Documentation of Cleaning Process:**
   - Maintained a detailed data cleaning log.
   - Used version control for tracking changes.

- Promote Popular Items: Leverage the popularity of the Classic category and Large size pizzas in marketing campaigns to attract more customers.

- Bundle Offers: Consider creating bundle offers that include the top-selling pizzas to increase average order value.

- Re-evaluate Underperforming Product: For the Brie Carre pizza, consider revising its recipe or marketing strategy, or replacing it with a new product if it continues to underperform.

- Loyalty Program: Implement a loyalty program to encourage repeat orders, especially targeting customers who order during peak times and prefer the popular items.
