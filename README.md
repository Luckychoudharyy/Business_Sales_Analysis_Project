# Bussiness Sales Analysis Project


#### Project overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a Pizza company over the 2015 year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance along with specific requirements by the client.

### Problem Statement

#### KPI's Requirement

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

#### Charts Requirement & Explainatory Data Analysis (EDA)

We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:
- What is the daily trend for total orders?
- What is the hourly trend for total orders?
- What is the percentage of sales for each pizza category?
- What is the percentage of sales for each pizza size?
- How many total pizzas were sold for each pizza category?
- Which pizzas are the top 5 best sellers based on total pizzas sold?
- Which pizzas are the bottom 5 worst sellers based on total pizzas sold?


# Prepare

### Data source & Integrity

The Primary dataset used for this analysis is the "pizza_sales.xlsx" file, containing detailed infoprmation about various aspects of the sales made by the company.
this Data was primarily Stored in a Kaggle dataset and was downloaded. The Data is in long format and was initially very Dirty. The data is Relialbe, Credible and comprehensive. it has all the information required for us to answer the bussiness questions. Initially SQL was used to clean and get our required KPI's and tables to form charts.
